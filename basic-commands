-a : This option is used to get alias name of the host system(if any). It will return an empty line if no alias name is set.
-A : This option is used to get all FQDNs(Fully Qualified Domain Name) of the host system. It enumerates all configured addresses on all network interfaces
-b : Used to always set a hostname. Default name is used if none specified
-d : This option is used to get the Domain if local domains are set. It will not return anything(not even a blank line) if no local domain is set.
-f : This option is used to get the Fully Qualified Domain Name(FQDN). It contains short hostname and DNS domain name
-F : This option is used to set the hostname specified in a file. Can be performed by the superuser(root) only.
     sudo hostname -F filename
-i :This option is used to get the IP(network) addresses. This option works only if the hostname is resolvable
-I : This option is used to get all IP(network) addresses. The option doesn’t depend on resolvability of hostname
-s : This option is used to get the hostname in short. The short hostname is the section of hostname before the first period/dot(.).
